# NewsAPI-
This project is a web application that fetches the latest news articles from a news API and displays them on a webpage. The user interface consists of a card-based layout where each card represents a news article. Each card contains an image, a title, and a link to the full article.

The application provides a seamless user experience with a dynamic search feature. Users can enter keywords into a search bar, and the application filters the news articles to display only those matching the search query. This allows users to easily find relevant articles based on their interests.

Key Features:

Provides a search bar for filtering articles based on user input.
Offers a clickable link to view the full article for each news item.
Overall, this project provides a convenient way for users to stay updated with the latest news and find articles on topics of interest efficiently.


-Apologies for any inconvenience you may experience with the website, especially if you're accessing it on your mobile device. My CSS skills are not very strong, so there might be some issues with the website's layout or responsiveness on smaller screens.

-Additionally, you may notice that sometimes there's a delay in displaying error messages, even though I've set up promises properly.

Rest assured, I'm working on improving this aspect of the website to ensure a smoother user experience. Thank you for your understanding! ^-^
